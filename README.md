# 🚀 Smart Enterprise Modernization Hackathon

Welcome to the **Smart Enterprise Modernization Hackathon** project! This repository contains a comprehensive data engineering and AI pipeline built on Databricks, demonstrating cutting-edge technologies in Big Data, Delta Lake, MLflow, and AI integrations. The project focuses on transforming and modernizing enterprise vehicle fleet data for actionable insights.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project is a modular, end-to-end solution divided into the following parts:

- **Data Ingestion:** Collects and simulates vehicle fleet data from diverse sources like REST APIs, CSV files, and IoT simulators.
- **Data Transformation:** Cleanses raw data and applies Delta Lake ETL pipelines to create curated feature-rich datasets.
- **AI Layer:** Trains and manages machine learning models with MLflow and prototypes an AI-powered chatbot to provide natural language insights.
- **API Export:** (Upcoming) Planning a unified API layer for seamless access to data and AI predictions.
- **Dashboard Visualization:** Interactive dashboards creating meaningful KPI visualizations for business stakeholders.
